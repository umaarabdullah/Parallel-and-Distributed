exe_time.txt contains cpu execution time in the following format:
    ts - serial time
    p    tp - parallel time using strategy 1 Row and Column wise one to all broadcast
    p    tp - parallel time using strategy 2 pipelining
    p  is the number of worker process

speedup = Ts(n)/Tp(n,p)

Two graph lines : parallelFloyd and pipelineFloyd

Need openmpi, python3, numpy, matplotlib,

Just ./run.sh
